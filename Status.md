# Status of the API #

At the moment not all features of the Basecamp API are supported. Posts, comments and milestones work pretty well. However I haven't had  time-tracking. Neither do I use these feature in Basecamp nor do I have an account to try this out. If you really need a feature you can drop me an email and we figure something out.
